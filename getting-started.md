# Getting Started With Strata
## Pre-requisites
To begin with, you will need the AWS CDK Installed on your local environment.

See https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk#at-a-glance on how to get started with that. 

Once installed you will need StrataCore installed. 
If you have artifactory configured, you can run

```
pip install StrataCore
```
 otherwise checkout out 
 
https://github.skyscannertools.net/strata/strata-config 

and install it from the source. 



## Initialising a New Repo

Starting a new Strata Repository is easy! 

### using the strata cli 

```strata-cli init <repo-name>-strata```
This will clone the strata-template repository which provides you with enough to get started.
